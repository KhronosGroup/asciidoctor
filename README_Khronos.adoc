= Khronos Stylesheet Fork of Asciidoctor

Khronos maintains a custom stylesheet for use with some of its
specifications, based on the asciidoctor default stylesheet.

To help track changes in the upstream, Khronos has forked the asciidoctor
repository into https://github.com/KhronosGroup/asciidoctor .

The `main` branch of this repository tracks the asciidoctor upstream, while
the Khronos stylesheet is located in the `khronos` branch.

See link:src/stylesheets/README.adoc[src/stylesheets/README.adoc] for more
information and build instructions.
